# Personalised Synthetic Controls

The use of statistical (parametric) models to act as counter-factual evidence
in the estimation of treatment effects.  See the [psc.r](https://github.com/richJJackson/psc)
package for more detils

# Idenfication of predictive markers

Looking at developing tools to make it easier to detect predictive biomarkers in

## Didi plots

Looking at a new way to visualise survival data when you have a continous
covariate and a KM plot just wont do! see [didi.r](https://github.com/richJJackson/didi)!

## 'Centered' hazard estimates

Looking at using weights to help us esitmate hazard ratios which are centered on
a particular biomarker value!

## Design of phase II trials with unequal Allocation ratios

Looking at how unequal allocation ratios may give smaller sample sizes/greater
power in phase II clinical trials

## Survival Design

A useful function for the design of clincial trials with a survival endpoint.
Including estimation of event rates and recruitment forcasts
