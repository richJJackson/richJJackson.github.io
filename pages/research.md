# Personalised Synthetic Controls 
The use of statistical (parametric) models to act as counter-factual evidence
in the estimation of treatment effects.  See the [psc.r](https://github.com/richJJackson/psc) 
package for more detils
# Idenfication of predictive markers
Looking at developing tools to make it easier to detect predictive biomarkers in
## Didi plots
Looking at a new way to visualise survival data when you have a continous 
covariate and a KM plot just wont do! see [didi.r](https://github.com/richJJackson/didi)!
## 'Centered' hazard estimates
Looking at using weights to help us esitmate hazard ratios which are centered on 
a particular biomarker value!
