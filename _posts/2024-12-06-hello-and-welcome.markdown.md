My name is Richard and I'm a Statistician (all: "Hello Richard"). If you've stumbled across this, then hopefully you are too. Good to see you.

**A bit about me**

I've spent the last 15 years or so working in Liverpool University and developed a career focussing primarily on statistics for Cancer research.  This has involved running and designing clinical trials, searching for predictive biomarkers and lately has taken me into developing Causal Inference tools to help us understand which treatments work best for patients.

At the moment I am working through my NIHR advanced fellowship which involves developing a causal inference tools which can make use of statistical models as counter-factual evidence.

**Whats this about?**

Well, in many ways stats can be tricky.  One of the things you learn early as a statistician is the amount you don't know (yet!) and that can be intimidating.  

Of course the proper way to handle this is to be open about what you do/don't know and remain open to learning discussing new topics...

Or you could pretend to know exactly what people are talking about, bluff your way through conversations and then quickly ~~research~~ google exactly whats going on.  

I tended to take the later approach.  Perhaps not the healthiest.  I will work on that.  

What I hope this will be is a gentle introduction to the areas of stats I find interesting, and a chance to have a bit of discussion.  A space to ask the awkward question or (politely) tell me exactly how wrong I am!

**What will you find here?**

Really i don't know yet.  But I guess the *intention* is:  

* An introduction to my research; an exploration of causal inference tools and how they compare to clinical trials
* A look at searching for predictive markers in Cancer
* An introduction to some of the 'tools' I've developed to help me along the way
* Anything else that seems relevant....

So if any of this sounds interesting do have a look.  I assure you I have every intention of updating this regularly.... lets see how that goes!
