A problem you don't know how to solve can be really irritating.

This one was given to me by a Herpetologist.   At the time I was 'acting director of statistics' at the Liverpool Cancer Trials Unit.  A much loftier title than I deserved.  In hindsight it was probably given due to the impending MHRA inspection, but I digress.

Liver Cancer, that was the topic of the meeting, or to be more precise: how it should be treated when it's advanced.  For a long time the standard of care had been Sorafenib.  This was backed up by a number of phase III clinical trials - a lot of research, time and money had been spent on this question.  But as is often the case there was a suspicion that something better could be achieved.

This Herpetologist in particular had a model for Sorafenib.  A good model based on RCT data and validated on real world patients [1].  You can see how it works here: https://prediction-models.liverpool.ac.uk/prosash.html.  As well as this there was also data on a new treatment and at first glance it looked pretty good....

The problem then:  Can we compare the model and the dataset in a reliable way? And if so - does the new treatment work.

There is of course a third problem - convincing others that this is a reasonable thing to do.  But one thing at a time.

The approach we developed we would go on to refer to as 'Personalised Synthetic Controls' and would become the focus of my fellowship.  As we go on I will start to explain what they are, how they were developed and what we are doing to develop them further.

Stay tuned.
